# MDPN
Unified notation for Markov Decision Processes (MDP)s

Building on the efforts of Philip Thomas in this [arXiv:1512.09075](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.09075), this effort build a common Latex style for writing MDP related stuff. 

## Why?
* Have a standard notation, to save everyone time (readers, writers) of anything related to MDPs and friends
* It is annoying to write the same paragraphs in every paper while trying to avoid self plagiarizing at the same time. This effort replaces such a paragraph with a single phrase.
